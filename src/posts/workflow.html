            The hardest part about running this website should be writing. It shouldn’t be the auxiliary effort involved
            in transpiling, categorizing, formatting, and uploading an already finished post — as it currently is.
        <p>
            I’d like to preface the following content with a note that while the focus of this website certainly won’t
            be technical, there will be exceptions, and this is one of them.
        <p>
            Here’s the (sad excuse for a) workflow the first post went through. It was first written on Google Docs, and
            then manually converted into HTML body text, with me creating tags and breaking/spacing lines as
            necessary. Of course, before this, I had to create a new HTML file for it, maintaining the proper file
            structure, updating the main page, adding the requisite &lt;head&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags, and linking
            its navigation bar back to the main page. Next, the server had to be updated, as did my local files, as did
            Github.
        <p>
            It may sound bad (because it is), but it’s certainly liveable. It’s not a deal-breaking amount of effort,
            and if I weren’t aware there were better ways to do it, I probably would have even been satisfied. The
            unfortunate part is that better ways — much better ways — do exist.
        <p>
            Like using a prebuilt website or an existing blog creator. But that’s lame, and within apple pie limits, I
            want to do this whole thing from scratch.
        <p>
            I’ve already automated 99% of the process of updating the server with the files I’ve got locally. I wrote a
            tiny .bat script that uses PuTTy (SSH authentication done with Pageant, so a bit faster) to clone my local
            files over to the server. The flaw is that it doesn’t delete old files, something I’ll have to eventually
            address with more care than a wipe/recreate.
        <p>
            The lion’s share of future optimization lies in transforming the pretty, formatted text of Google Docs to a
            properly templated and categorized HTML file, recreating the necessary hyperlink structure on relevant
            pages, and updating my local storage, the server, and Github, with no more work than pushing a single
            button.
        <p>
            Unless I’m missing something incredibly obvious, this will take a fair bit of work to get done, depending on
            how extensible I want whatever tool I build to be. Here’s the current plan I’ve got.
        <p>
            I can start by writing in Markdown. From that, converting to HTML isn’t hard. I can locally run a converter
            (ShowdownJS) to create the HTML body I need. From there, I can generate the rest of the necessary HTML for
            that page using a templating engine (Liquid, probably). After I’ve got the shiny new document, I’d have to
            update all the pages that would link to it, and update the main page. I can probably do this just using the
            same templating engine, and this would require that most, if not all, of the pages are rewritten to be
            intelligent templates and not the hard-coded static code they currently are.
        <p>
            After this, I’d have to automate the updating of all three (local, server, VCS) data stores, and trigger the
            website update script I’ve already got. And after that, I could start adding all the extensibility I might
            ever need.
        <p>
            I’ll probably create another category for coding stuff and post updates. But all that comes after the
            aforementioned automation. I’ve got relatively little work this week, so hopefully this “manual” post is the
            last of its kind.</p>
