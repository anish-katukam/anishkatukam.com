            Well, this was a few days late, partly because of technical difficulties and mostly because the hours I
            normally write these (midnight to two) was actually spent asleep for once.
        <p>
            This week was great. Maybe that’s just because the week following midterms week feels significantly slower
            and more relaxed (obviously), but the average day this week was certainly closer to what I want it to be. I
            met the basic human requirements of sleeping and waking up on time (abnormal for me), I worked out daily,
            and I read a fair bit.
        <p>
            A few weeks ago, I talked about my possibly detrimental attitudes towards self-improvement and how I might
            consider going about fixing that. I think I’ve properly accepted the idea of incremental change, and tried
            exercising it over these last two weeks. I think it’s worked out well. It has of course only been two weeks,
            so no conclusions can be drawn as to how ingrained these habits are so far. The point is, at least
            internally, I think I’m improving more under these paradigms than the previous ones. Not to imply I can
            accurately state what paradigms I hold, of course, but it seems that way.
        <p>
            Spring break’s coming up this next week and I’ve already finished all the important work due during or after
            it, so I’ve mentally checked out of school for the next few days. Not that it’s much of a loss, seeing as
            all the lectures preceding long breaks tend to be abnormally short and the teachers refreshingly apathetic.
        <p>
            With the mandatory workload from school greatly reduced these next few days, I feel they will be fairly
            indicative of how my attitude towards free time has changed over the last few months. I’m not going to force
            myself to be productive because losing three days isn’t a great loss, and I’d rather get the opportunity to
            honestly look at myself again devoid of external requirements and see what happens. I’d like to think I’m
            cautiously optimistic.
