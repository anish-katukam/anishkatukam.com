            <i>East of Eden</i> said this:
        <p>
            <i> “Time interval is a strange and contradictory matter in the mind. It would be reasonable to suppose that
                a routine time or an eventless time would seem interminable. It should be so, but it is not. It is the
                dull eventless times that have no duration whatever. A time splashed with interest, wounded with
                tragedy, crevassed with joy - that's the time that seems long in the memory. And this is right when you
                think about it. Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on. From nothing to nothing is no time at
                all.”</i>
        <p>
            <i>“Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on.”</i>
        <p>
            This sentence perfectly summarizes that feeling we all know — when you look back and the days have blended
            together because there’s nothing to separate them. Sometimes we notice this happening, and since reading
            that quote, I’d like to think I’ve been somewhat more cognizant of when it happens to me. But I don’t think
            I’ve done very much to avoid it.
        <p>
            This website was intended as, to put it crudely, a tracker of time and thoughts. I think so far it’s made
            for a good one of the latter, but judging by the four posts in as many months, I don’t think it’s been a
            good tracker of time.
        <p>
            I want to be able to tell the difference between the days. I currently can’t. I’ll settle for weeks, and to
            that end, I want to hold myself to a sort of weekly write-up on what that week has been. It isn’t meant to
            be a list of things that happened, but something that lends me a clear picture of what that week has been. I
            want to be able to look back and hopefully see some semblance of change or progress, and I feel like this
            sort of concrete display of what I have and haven’t done would help.
        <p>
            I don’t really know what I did this week, but for this coming one, I’m going to try to be a bit more alive
            and a bit less routine. Not that my routine consists of much else than waking up late and occasionally
            working out, so that could use some work too. We’ll see how it goes.
