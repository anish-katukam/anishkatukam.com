            Sun’s breaking through those clouds outside.
        <p>
            Winter break is over. And with it leave a few wonderful weeks of friends, family, relaxation, and a medley
            of other unexpectedly enjoyable activities. I worked on most of the things I wanted to work on, met all the
            people I wanted to, read some of the books I’d have liked to, and spoke with a monk.
        <p>
            So here we are again at the onset of another semester. In some ways, a fresh slate; in some ways, the same
            old.
        <p>
            I’ve had a lot of time this last month to take a step back from myself in a way precluded by the previous
            semester. I’m incredibly optimistic about what I can do with these next four months, academically and
            otherwise (leaning otherwise).
        <p>
            A little while back, one of my friends said that I was earnest about self-improvement. I remember an intense
            feeling of being a fraud; of having seemingly accidentally convinced someone that I was the person I wanted
            to be; and for having apparently misrepresented myself.
        <p>
            By the close of this coming half-year, I would like to be able to take that compliment and be able to
            believe it. If not entirely, atleast moreso.
        <p>
            I am going to do the things I want to have done.
