            Are regular things worth recording here? I’m not sure. Every previous week, or preceding a post, I had a
            very well-defined idea of what I was going to write. I have nothing like that for this week. I’m not sure
            why that is.
        <p>
            It’s not like I’m short on things to write about in general, it’s just that I haven’t given enough
            concentrated thought to one to be able to expand on it here. Instead, most of this week and the weekend
            consisted of me desperately trying to get my computer to work properly (read: not crash every fifteen
            minutes). Other than that, it was the standard skating by school (not a great plan when it was midterms
            week) and the standard mix of postponing things I “want” to do. Not to say I’ve not done somewhat valuable
            things this week. I’ve made progress in a textbook I’ve picked up for myself, read some more books, both
            fiction and non-fiction, and, well, that’s all, I think.
        <p>
            That’s sort of disappointing. I haven’t really done much this week and I should wonder why a bit more, but
            there’s a fair bit of apathy towards that. To be fair, historically, midterm weeks are always a fair bit
            less productive than normal. I’m not sure if that’s excusable, because it’s not like the extra time was
            spent studying. I haven’t worked out at all this week.
        <p>
            Speaking of which, some of my grades are not where they should be right now. I need to take steps to fix
            this, but I have problems when it comes to maintaining some sort of discipline, especially when the next
            rounds of midterms are a month and a bit away.
        <p>
            I’m not sure where to go from there. Setting up self-restrictions without last-minute pressures have never
            been easy; most of what I do that isn’t due within the next few hours tends to be a result of a momentary
            decision rather than a system I have. If I can consistently make that momentary decision, perhaps things
            would be fine, but that hasn’t ever been the case. I think it has improved in the last few months, though,
            or at least I’d like to think so.
        <p>
            This comes back to the overall lack of discipline I have. I’ve always been able to get by because I think I
            work well under the pressure provided by imminent deadlines, but as for working ahead and bettering myself,
            I’ve always lagged because there are no given deadlines. I don’t believe setting up a schedule or something
            is going to help, but there are definitely things I can do to set up a more successful day.
        <p>
            Maintaining a proper sleep schedule is certainly one of them, and possibly one of the more effective ones.
            It’s generally pretty hard to enforce or maintain. Maybe if I convince myself that this is one of the
            prerequisites to the other things I want to be I’ll be better able to hold myself to it. I’ll try doing that
            for the upcoming week and see how it goes.
